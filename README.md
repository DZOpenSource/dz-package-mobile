**Hybrid mobile application.**

  

## Development

  

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

  

[Node.js]([https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)): We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.

Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

  

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.

You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

  

    npm install

  

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

  

    ionic serve

  

You will be able to see your app in the browser.
